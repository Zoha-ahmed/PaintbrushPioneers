      <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>Objective: </strong>
        To introduce children to color theory through an engaging painting activity that involves mixing primary colors to create secondary colors and exploring the concept of color harmony.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>Materials Needed: </strong>
        Canvases or thick paper for each child, Watercolor or acrylic paints in primary colors (red, blue, yellow), Paintbrushes, Water cups for cleaning brushes, Palette or disposable plates for mixing colors, Aprons or old shirts to protect clothing, Table cover or newspaper for easy cleanup</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 1rem; padding-right: 1rem;">Instructions:</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>1. Introducing Primary Colors: </strong>
        Start by introducing the concept of primary colors (red, blue, and yellow.) Show examples of these colors and explain that all other colors can be created by mixing these primary colors in various combinations.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>2. Demonstrate Color Mixing: </strong>
        Use a palette or disposable plates to mix two primary colors together, showing how they create secondary colors (e.g., red & blue = purple, blue & yellow = green, red & yellow = orange).</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>3. Canvas Prep: </strong>
        Distribute the canvas or canvases and explain that they will be creating their own colorful masterpieces by mixing primary colors directly on their canvas. Encourage them to think about the colors they want to use and the mood they want to convey in their artwork.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>4. Painting: </strong>
        Let the children start painting their canvases. Encourage them to experiment with color mixing directly on the canvas by layering and blending primary colors to create new shades. Offer guidance and assistance as needed, but allow them the freedom to explore and express themselves.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>5. Observation and Discussion: </strong>
        Once the paintings are complete, gather the children to discuss the colors they used and how different combinations make them feel while they dry. Talk about color harmony and ask them to share if they have created any favorite color combinations. Emphasize the beauty of using a variety of colors to create a visually appealing artwork.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>6. Gallery Walk (If The Group Is Large Enough): </strong>
        Arrange the finished artworks in a gallery-like display. Allow each child to share their painting with the group, explaining the color choices and any special meanings behind their artwork. Encourage positive feedback and appreciation for each other's creations.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>7. Closing Activity: </strong>
        Conclude the activity by summarizing the key concepts learned about primary and secondary colors, color mixing, and color harmony. Commend the children for their creativity and effort, and encourage them to continue exploring the world of colors in future art projects.</p>
