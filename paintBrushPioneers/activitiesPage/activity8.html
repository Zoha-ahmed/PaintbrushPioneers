    <h1 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 1rem; padding-right: 1rem;">Instructions:</h1>

    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>1. Introduction to Balanced Nutrition: </strong>
        Begin by introducing the primary colors (red, blue, yellow) and explaining the concept of color mixing to create secondary colors. Show examples of color combinations and discuss the feelings or moods associated with different colors.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>2. Design Planning: </strong>
        Discuss the design options with the child. Talk about patterns, shapes, and color combinations they might want to use on their clothing items. Encourage them to sketch their ideas on paper or outline their design mentally.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>3. Clothing Preparation: </strong>
        Place a piece of plastic or cardboard inside the clothing to prevent the paint from bleeding through. If the child is using stencils or templates, help secure them in place with painter's tape or masking tape.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>4. Color Mixing: </strong>
        Pour a small amount of each fabric paint color onto paper plates to create a palette. Discuss the colors chosen and encourage the child to experiment with mixing colors to create new shades.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>5. Customization Adventure: </strong>
        Allow the child to express their creativity by painting and customizing their clothing items. Provide guidance on color choices, but let them take the lead in designing and applying the colors. Use brushes, fabric markers, or fabric crayons to create the desired effects.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>6. Exploration of Color Combinations : </strong>
        While working on the project, discuss the color combinations the child is using. Ask questions about why they chose specific colors and how they feel about the overall design. Encourage them to experiment with complementary or contrasting colors.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>7. Drying Time: </strong>
        Allow the customized clothing items to dry completely. This can be a good time to take a break, nap, or engage in another short activity.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>8. Show and Tell: </strong>
        Once the clothing items are dry, have a "Fashion Color Splash" fashion show. Let the child model their creations and share the design choices they made. Encourage them to talk about the colors and patterns they used.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>9. Discussion on Clothing Care: </strong>
        Sit down with the child to reflect on the activity. Discuss the color theory concepts learned during the process, including color mixing, combinations, and the visual impact of different colors in their designs. Discuss having care for clothing and treating it well so it lasts for a long time. Optionally you can sit down with the child and help them organize their closet for the advent of new clothes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>10. Fashion Gallery Display (Optional): </strong>
        If multiple clothing items were customized, create a "Fashion Gallery" display at home to showcase the colorful creations. This can be a fun and proud moment for the child to share their designs with family and friends.</p>
