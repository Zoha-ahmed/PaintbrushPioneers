    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>1. Color Introduction: </strong>
        If this is the first activity your child is doing and is unfamiliar with the concept of mixing colors, begin by discussing primary colors (red, blue, yellow) and briefly introduce the concept of color mixing to create secondary colors. Show examples or visuals to help the child understand how different colors can be combined to form new colors.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>2. Nature Walk Checklist (For Children Who Can Read): </strong>
        Show the child a blank color wheel template. Explain the arrangement of primary and secondary colors on the wheel. Discuss the idea of warm and cool colors and how they can be organized in a circular format.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>3. Color Exploration: </strong>
        Provide the child with various colored objects or materials. Ask them to identify and sort the items based on their hues, emphasizing different shades and intensities. Discuss warm and cool colors as they explore the materials.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>4. Color Wheel Creation: </strong>
        Give the child a blank color wheel template and instruct them to match and glue or tape the colored objects onto the corresponding sections of the wheel. Encourage them to be creative and use different shades to fill in each segment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>5. Discussion and Reflection: </strong>
        As the child works on their color wheel, engage in discussions about the colors they are using and their placement on the wheel. Ask questions about which colors are neighbors, opposites, or complementary. Discuss the concept of harmonious color schemes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>6. Show and Tell: </strong>
        Once the color wheel is complete, have the child present their creation. Ask them to explain the color choices and any patterns they notice on their color wheel. Encourage them to share their understanding of color relationships.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>7. Display: </strong>
        Mount the completed color wheels on a large poster board or paper. Display them in a visible area at home. Take a moment to appreciate each child's unique color wheel and discuss how the colors work together to create a harmonious composition.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        <strong>8. Optional Follow Up Activity (7+): </strong>
        Challenge the child to create a small artwork or drawing using the principles they learned about color theory from their color wheel. This can be an opportunity for them to apply their newfound knowledge in a creative way.</p>
